* [The exercise](#the-exercise)

## Getting started

Once you have a copy of this repository:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16.x
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd buffer-code-exercise
npm install
```

3. Start up the local server in development mode

```bash
npm start
```

Now you'll have a local server running at http://localhost:8080! Follow
along to the next section to learn more about how this project is organized.
## About this repo

### Client side code

The client code is located in `/client`. The main entry point or root file
is `client.js`. This is the starting file from which all other modules are
imported and referenced. Files can be imported using [ES2015 style `import` modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)
or the [commonjs style `require` modules](http://www.commonjs.org/specs/modules/1.0/).
The front-end is built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) components.

When running the `npm start` command, [`webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/)
will be started. Webpack is a build tool that will automatically bundle your
code into a single file. This bundled file will be created in `/public`.

All static assets like javascript files, stylesheets, and images should be
placed in the `/public` directory. When the server is started, these files will
all be available at `localhost:8080`.

### Server side code

The server code is located in `/server`. The main entry point is `server.js`.

The server is written using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) which is
similar to [Sinatra for Ruby](http://sinatrarb.com/),
[Flask for Python](http://flask.pocoo.org/), or
[Lumen for PHP](https://lumen.laravel.com/) if you are more familiar with
those languages.

The JSON database uses [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb)
along with [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10) library for
querying the data in `/server/database/db.json`.

## The exercise

We expect these tasks to take 4-5 hours, but they may take less for you. If you have any questions or would like clarification, email eng-hiring@buffer.com.

### How to complete the exercise

As you complete parts of the exercise, please `git commit ...` along the way, as you would normally work on a project. This is helpful for us in seeing how you work as well. When you are finished, submit your work by zipping your the `buffer-code-exercise` directory then emailing it to us. Please remove the `node_modules` directory before you zip, as it won't be necessary üòâ. You can use Mac's "create archive" feature, Window's "compressed (zipped) folder," or the zip cli on Linux.

Try to complete the tasks to the best of your ability. Good luck! üòÉ

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Tasks

1. Add a ‚ÄúLoad More‚Äù button at the end of the list of updates which loads the next 10 updates each time it's clicked
2. Append analytics from the "updates-analytics" collection to each update returned in the `/getUpdates` endpoint
3. Write a script in `/server/scripts/updateAnalyticsData.js` to fetch the most recent Tweet analytics from [the API](https://github.com/bufferapp/buffer-code-exercise-api#buffer-code-exercise-api) and update the "updates-analytics" records in the database.
4. Add new `/getAnalyticsTimeseries` endpoint which returns a timeseries of all update analytics, aggregated by the day that the update was sent: `[{ timestamp: 1526601600, retweets: 1, favorites: 2, clicks: 4 }, ...]`
5. [Extra credit] All of the React front-end is written using class components. Choose one (1) component to upgrade to a more modern approach (functional components, hooks for state and data fetching, etc.)

### Helpful notes & resources
